# PacMen_Exercise
 
<strong>Description</strong>

By generating an endless variety of Pacmen with different starting positions and speeds, this game can create a unique and unpredictable experience every time it is played. The webpage has a PacMan image moving randomly across the width of the page, with two buttons above it to add more PacMen and to start the game. The code checks for collisions with the window boundaries and changes the direction of the PacMan images accordingly. 

<strong>How-to-Run</strong>

The project requires no dependencies or setup before it can be run. Fork and then clone the repository to your local machine. Open the "index.html" file to load the webpage into your local browser.

<strong>Roadmap of future improvements</strong>

<ul>
<li>Creating a container for the PacMen to bounce in
<li>Making the PacMen chomp and flip the image once it reaches an edge
<li>Adding an “end game” button to stop the animations and clear them from the screen.
</ul>
